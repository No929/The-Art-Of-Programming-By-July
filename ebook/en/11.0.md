Chapter 11: Longest Common Subsequence 
===========

##1. Introduction
What is the so-called longest common subsequence (LCS)? Given a sequence S, if it's a subsequence of two or more sequence, and also the longest one among all the sequences that meet this condition, then S is the LCS of these sequences.

For example, given two random sequences: 1 3 4 5 5, and 2 4 5 5 7 6, their LCS is: 4 5 5.

There is another confusing concept called 'longest common substring', please pay attention to the difference between 'longest common substring' and 'longest common subsequence': a substring is a continual part of the original sequence, which means every element in a substring has to be adjacent in the original one; but a subsequence just needs to keep the order, the elements do not need to be adjacent. For example, for strings 'acdfg' and 'akdfc', their longest common substring is 'df', and longest common subsequence is 'adf'. The LCS problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming as described below.

##2. Ideas for the Solution
* Brute Force
  The easiest algorithm comes to us is Brute Force. For every subsequence of sequence X, check if it is the subsequence of sequence Y, therefore identify wheteher it is a common subsequence of X and Y, and record the longest one during this procedure. After all the subsequence of X is examined, we can get the LCS of X and Y.
